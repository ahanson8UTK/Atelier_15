## Two required sentences

1. **Evidence.** With α calibrated to the average **labor share** and δ implied by **I/Y**, my model’s IRFs show **[pattern]**, especially **[variable(s)]** over **[horizon]**.

2. **Limits.** I’d be convinced the model is missing **[mechanism]** because the data show **[fact]** while the model insists **[model pattern]**.

## Micro‑prompts ≤ 25 words each.

### A. Preference shock
- **A1 – Margins.** Did the **preference shock** mostly move **consumption–saving** or **labor–leisure**? Name the equation it shifts (Euler vs. intratemporal FOC).  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **A2 – Signs & humps.** After a **+Ξ** shock, what happens on impact to {**C**, **I**, **Y**, **L_s**}? Which has the strongest hump, and why?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **A3 – Persistence.** Change **ρ_Ξ** from 0.5 → 0.95. Describe how **amplitude** and **duration** of **C**’s IRF change.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

### B. Compare shocks: preference (Ξ), fiscal (ε_G), and technology (ε_Z)

Use your **composite IRF figure** from `04b_extend_fiscalshock.R` (one panel per shock; same scale).

- **B1 – Impact signs & ranking.** Rank the **impact** responses of **Y, C, I, L_s** across the three shocks; note any sign flips.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B2 – Crowding‑out.** For a **+ε_G** spending shock, which is crowded out more, **C** or **I**? Explain using **wealth vs. substitution** channels.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B3 – Persistence & hump shapes.** Which shock produces the **largest hump** in **I**? Which in **L_s**? Give the propagation mechanism.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B4 – Prices.** Compare **r** and **w** on impact across shocks. Which shock raises **r** the most, and why?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B5 – Output share logic.** Holding α, β, δ fixed, which shock most plausibly explains **short‑run Y** volatility in your calibration? Justify from the IRFs.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

---

### C. Choose one extension (implement, then reflect)

Pick **one** model change, re‑solve, and re‑plot IRFs for **ε_G**. Note your implementation in your repo commit message.

**Option C‑Prod (productive G):** make utility additively separable and add **+ψ · log G[]**. Keep lump‑sum taxes.  
**Option C‑Tax (distortionary):** replace lump‑sum financing with **T[] = τ_L · w[] · L[]**; use after‑tax wage in the household’s budget.

- **C1 – Your choice & equation.** State which option you chose and write the **one- or two‑line change** (utility term or tax rule).  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **C2 – Fiscal IRF change.** Under your option, how does **Y**’s response to **+ε_G** differ from the baseline? Name the key channel.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **C3 – Moment to target.** Name a data **moment** you’d use to pin down **ψ** or **τ_L**.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

---

## (Optional) One‑liner sanity checks for your future self
- Turning **ρ_Ξ → 0** kills the preference IRF quickly.  
- Setting **ψ = 0** returns the baseline (no productive G).  
- With **τ_L = 0** and **T[] = G[]**, you’re back to lump‑sum finance.  
- If **C/Y ≤ 0** at your **G/Y** target, lower **G/Y** or revisit β, δ.
