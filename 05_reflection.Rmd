## Two required sentences

1. **Evidence.** With α calibrated to the average **labor share** and δ implied by **I/Y**, my model’s IRFs show **[pattern]**, especially **[variable(s)]** over **[horizon]**.

2. **Limits.** I’d be convinced the model is missing **[mechanism]** because the data show **[fact]** while the model insists **[model pattern]**.

## Micro‑prompts (answer TWO total: ONE from A and ONE from B). ≤ 25 words each.

### A. Preference shock — pick one
- **A1 – Margins.** Did the **preference shock** mostly move **consumption–saving** or **labor–leisure**? Name the equation it shifts (Euler vs. intratemporal FOC).  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **A2 – Signs & humps.** After a **+Ξ** shock, what happens on impact to {**C**, **I**, **Y**, **L_s**}? Which has the strongest hump, and why?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **A3 – Persistence.** Change **ρ_Ξ** from 0.5 → 0.95. Describe how **amplitude** and **duration** of **C**’s IRF change.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

### B. Fiscal shock — pick one
- **B1 – Crowding‑out.** On impact of **+G** with **T = G** (lump‑sum), which falls more—**C** or **I**—and what mechanism explains it?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B2 – Resource check.** Does **ΔY ≈ ΔC + ΔI + ΔG** hold (first 8 quarters)? If not, what likely went wrong in your edit?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B3 – Wealth effect.** Did **L_s** rise or fall on impact after **+G**? Tie it to the wealth effect of lump‑sum taxes.  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

- **B4 – Calibration shift.** After setting **gY** from data (Step 3C), how did the **peak ΔY** change vs. **gY = 0.20**?  
  **Answer:** _[≤25 words]_

## (Optional) One‑liner sanity checks for your future self
- Turning **ρ_Ξ → 0** kills the preference IRF quickly; turning **gY → 0** eliminates fiscal effects.  
- If **“T”** doesn’t plot, remember it must be in quotes: `"T"` (bare `T` is `TRUE` in R).
